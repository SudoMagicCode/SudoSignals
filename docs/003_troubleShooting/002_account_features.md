# sudoSignals Features 

sudoSignals works with both installation licenses and a washboard subscription. You can select to have as many or as few installation license as make sense for your studio or business. Each installation machine that has a connection to the sudoSignals Dashboard needs it's own license. Your web Dashboard is a single pane of glass style interface that collects the stats and controls from all of your installations. There are three different web Dashboard tiers that are independent from your installation licenses. By upgrading your Dashboard you instantly have access to additional features for all of your installations. 

You can see a complete list of features for sudoSignals on our [Pricing](https://www.sudosignals.com/pricing) page.
