# Plugin API

Plugins use an API for communicating with the local sudoSignals service. While there are some existing plugins for sudoSignals, you're welcome to develop your own tools to better suite your organizations' needs. Coming soon we'll have a documentation set to outline how you can communicate with Signals directly and build your own plugin.
