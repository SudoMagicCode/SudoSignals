# Controlling a Remote Installation

In addition to process monitoring sudoSignals can also be used to remotely control your application. Remote operation requires that an application use a plugin to communicate directly with the signals service, which will act as a bridge to the dashboard.

SudoMagic has a starting set of open source plugins available for projects, with plans to continue development for additional platforms. You can see a list of all [officially supported plugins here](plugins.md).

If you'd like to build your own plugin please the documentation for the sudoSignals [service API](api.md).
