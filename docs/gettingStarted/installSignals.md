# Installing sudoSignals

sudoSignals runs as a local process on your Windows computer. In order for Signals to monitor your applications, we need to install the local service to keep your installation looking its best.

## 1. Download sudoSignals

Here is the [latest sudoSignals installer](https://github.com/SudoMagicCode/sudoSignals_releases/releases/latest/download/SudoSignals_Installer.msi).


If you need an older version of Signals, you can see all of the [sudoSignals releases here](https://github.com/SudoMagicCode/sudoSignals_releases/releases).

## 2. Run the Installer
After downloading the installer, it's time to get sudoSignals up and running. Start by double clicking the installer.

### Windows Protection

```note
We're working on getting our Windows application publisher certificate. In the meantime, there's an extra step to getting the installer working. 
```

You should see a warning from Windows about an application from an unknown publisher.

### Select Installation Type

There are three different Setup Types for Signals. If you'd like to use our recommend settings, select `Typical` â€” this will install Signals for you automatically. If you'd like to designate where Signals is installed select `Custom`. Right now `Complete` has all of the same installation elements as `Typical`, in future releases we're planning on having some more advanced features for users to select.
