# Controlling a Remote Installation

In addition to process monitoring, sudoSignals can also be used to remotely control your application. Remote operation requires that an application use a plugin to communicate directly with the Signals service, which will act as a bridge to the Dashboard.

SudoMagic has a starting set of open source plugins available for projects, with plans to continue development for additional platforms. You can see a list of all [officially supported plugins here](https://docs.sudosignals.com/002_plugins/).

If you'd like to build your own plugin please review the documentation for the sudoSignals [service API](https://docs.sudosignals.com/004_api/).
