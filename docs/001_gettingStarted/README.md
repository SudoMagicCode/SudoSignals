# Getting Started

sudoSignals is an application monitor that's connected to a web dashboard. To get started we need to install the local sudoSignals client application, and also configure the client to connect to your dashboard account. This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to get your account set-up, and to make sure you've got an application that you can control remotely.
