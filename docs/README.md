# sudoSignals

sudoSignals is an application monitor and remote operation service. A local service application communicates with applications locally, and then acts as a bridge to the remote dashboard. It's important to understand the mechanics of how Signals operates in order to best take advantage of this tool, and have a seamless remote operation experience. 

## What is this resource?

This resource is the single source documentation guide for working both with the sudoSignals local application, with the web dashboard, with any [SudoMagic](https://www.sudomagic.com/) created plugins, and with the Signals API (helpful if you're going to create your own plugin).
