# sudoSignals Version 2 - Coming Soon

sudoSignals is an application monitor and remote operation service.

With Signals, a local client application communicates with an applications locally, and then acts as a bridge to a remote, web Dashboard. It's important to understand the mechanics of how Signals operates in order to best take advantage of this tool, and have a seamless remote operation experience.

This resource is the single source documentation guide for working with the sudoSignals local application, with the web Dashboard, with any [SudoMagic](https://www.sudomagic.com/) created plugins, and with the Signals API (helpful if you're going to create your own plugin).
