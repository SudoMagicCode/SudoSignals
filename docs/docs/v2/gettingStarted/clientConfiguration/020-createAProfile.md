# Create a Profile

sudoSignals uses `Profiles` to create groups of different programs, and allows users to have multiple sets of processes they want sudoSignals to control.

:::info Terminology

`Profiles` are lists of processes.

:::

## Profile Setup

On Configuration tab, the left column shows all Profiles available on your machine. On install, sudoSignals comes with a `Default` profile that you can use for your projects. You can rename that profile or delete it.

Additionally, you can create a new profile using the `+ Create New Profile` button.

We recommend that you name your profile something descriptive.

Once your profile is created, it should appear in the Profiles list.

## Set Current Profile

To set this new profile as your active profile, navigate to the Overview tab and select the profile from the dropdown list and hit `Apply`.
