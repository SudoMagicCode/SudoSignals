# Configure the Client

sudoSignals runs as a local process on your Windows computer, and is controlled via an online web Dashboard.

Once you have downloaded sudoSignals client, you can start configuring your machine. Open the sudoSignals client to get started.

When you first start the client, you will see the status as `initializing.` To learn more about sudoSignals' statuses, visit [Status Indicators](../../dashboard-anatomy/status-indicators).
