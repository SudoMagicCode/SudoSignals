# Configure the Client

When you first start the client, you will see the status as `initializing.` To learn more about sudoSignals' statuses, visit [Status Indicators](../../dashboard-anatomy/status-indicators).

Initially, the profile will be set to `Default` â€” review the next section to learn how to create your own profile.
