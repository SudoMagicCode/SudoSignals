# Using Delays

Delays are a helpful way to organize your processes and add `delay` to their startup.

## Adding Delays

On Configuration tab, the Processes column has a button to `Add Delay`.

### Adjusting Delays

By default, delays are set to `5 seconds`. Click on the clock icon to adjust the duration of the delay.

A dialog will appear where you can adjust the duration (in seconds).

The placement of the delay can also be adjusted by using the handle icon (left) of the delay card.
