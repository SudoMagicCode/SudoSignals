# Create an Installation

An `installation` acts like a folder and can contain multiple machines. 

## Open the sudoSignals Dashboard

Start by heading to the sudoSignals dashboard at [dashboard.sudosignals.com](https://dashboard.sudosignals.com/)

## Create an Installation

If you're creating your first installation you can click `Create Installation`.

If you already have an installation, and want to add another click the plus icon in the upper right to create a new installation.

## Name Your Installation

When the Create New Installation dialogue opens you can enter a descriptive name for your installation and the click `Create It`.

After creating your installation, you'll be directed back to your dashboard where you can see a card with all of the at-a-glance details for your installation.

Congratulations, you've created your first sudoSignals installation.  

Your first installation is free, and you can create as many installations as you need for the projects you need to monitor.
