# Logs

Logs provide realtime updates about the performance of your machine and its processes.

Both the sudoSignals client on your machine and your machine's processes can report log messages to the dashboard. Logs are string-based messages that are intended to be human readable. Logs have three different levels of importance:

* Log
* Info
* Critical
* Warning
* Alert
