## Installation Alerts

Signals can be configured to send an alert for: 

- All Machines
  - Machines Processes
- All Processes
  - Specific Processes
- Log Alerts

Note that when installation, machine or process going offline may be due to a power outage, a computer restart, or an interruption in internet connectivity.

:::info

When sudoSignals is set to Auto Restart your process, it will restart your application even if it crashes. When process alerts are enabled, you may still get a notification that your process has fallen offline so that you can investigate at your earliest convenience.

## Alert Settings

In the Alert settings, there is the ability to mute notifications for a fixed duration of time.
