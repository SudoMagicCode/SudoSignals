# Plugins

Plugins are used to communicate between Signals and an application. They allow you to remotely control your installations and to send data to and from the Dashboard.

The [SudoMagic](https://www.sudomagic.com/) team has some open source plugins that are officially supported.

If you're interested in contributing a plugin for official support [please contact us by visiting this page](http://sudosignals.com/contact)
